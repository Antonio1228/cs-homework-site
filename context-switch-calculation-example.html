    <h1>Context Switch Calculation Example (Step by Step)</h1>

    <p>
        A context switch takes CPU time as overhead. This example shows how to calculate CPU utilization when context
        switch time occurs during scheduling.
    </p>

    <h2>Given</h2>

    <pre>
Time Quantum (RR) = 4 ms
Context Switch Time = 1 ms (every time the CPU switches from one process to another)

Assume 3 processes arrive at time 0:
P1 burst = 10 ms
P2 burst = 6 ms
P3 burst = 8 ms
</pre>

    <h2>Step 1: Build the Round Robin Execution Order</h2>

    <p>
        With time quantum 4 ms, each process runs for up to 4 ms each turn.
    </p>

    <pre>
Cycle 1: P1 (4) -> P2 (4) -> P3 (4)
Remaining: P1 6, P2 2, P3 4

Cycle 2: P1 (4) -> P2 (2) -> P3 (4)
Remaining: P1 2, P2 0, P3 0

Cycle 3: P1 (2)
Remaining: P1 0
</pre>

    <h2>Step 2: Count Number of CPU Switches</h2>

    <p>
        Each time the CPU moves from one process to another, we pay 1 ms overhead.
    </p>

    <h3>Execution Segments</h3>

    <pre>
1) P1 (4)
2) P2 (4)
3) P3 (4)
4) P1 (4)
5) P2 (2)
6) P3 (4)
7) P1 (2)
</pre>

    <p>
        Number of switches between segments = segments - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6
    </p>

    <h2>Step 3: Total CPU Work Time (Useful Time)</h2>

    <pre>
Total burst time = 10 + 6 + 8 = 24 ms
Useful CPU time = 24 ms
</pre>

    <h2>Step 4: Total Context Switch Overhead</h2>

    <pre>
Overhead = number_of_switches * context_switch_time
Overhead = 6 * 1 ms = 6 ms
</pre>

    <h2>Step 5: Total Time and CPU Utilization</h2>

    <pre>
Total time = useful time + overhead
Total time = 24 + 6 = 30 ms

CPU Utilization = useful time / total time
CPU Utilization = 24 / 30 = 0.8 = 80%
</pre>

    <h2>Result</h2>

    <pre>
Useful CPU time = 24 ms
Context switch overhead = 6 ms
Total elapsed time = 30 ms
CPU Utilization = 80%
</pre>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>
        Context switching reduces CPU utilization because it adds overhead time. Smaller time quantum may increase the
        number of context switches, leading to more overhead.
