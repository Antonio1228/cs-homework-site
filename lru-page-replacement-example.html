    <h1>LRU Page Replacement Example (Step by Step)</h1>

    <p>
        LRU (Least Recently Used) page replacement algorithm replaces the page that has not been used for the longest
        time when a new page needs to be loaded into memory.

Total Page Faults = 9
</pre>

    <h2>How LRU Decides the Victim Page</h2>

    <p>
        When a page fault happens and the frames are full, LRU chooses the page that was used least recently (the one
        with the oldest last-used time) and replaces it with the new page.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>
        LRU often performs better than FIFO because it uses recent usage history. However, it may be more expensive to
        implement because the system must track page usage order.
